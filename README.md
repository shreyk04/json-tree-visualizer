React Tree Visualizer

A simple and interactive Tree Visualizer built using React Flow, Tailwind CSS, and React.
You can visualize any JSON-like hierarchical data structure as a connected tree, search through nodes, toggle between light/dark themes, and download the visualization as an image.

🚀 Features

📊 Tree Visualization using React Flow

🔍 Search Node with smooth zoom & highlight

🌗 Light / Dark Theme Toggle

📸 Download Visualization as PNG (includes nodes + edges)

🧩 Dynamic Node Generation from nested JSON

🌳 How It Works

The tree structure is generated dynamically from nested JSON data.

Each key/value pair is represented as a node connected via edges.

You can search any node name — if it exists, the view smoothly pans and highlights it.

The Theme Toggle button switches between light and dark modes.

You can download the current visualization (including edges) as an image.
